# A cake that can tweet

This is part of the "Internet of ordinary things" movement:  
We take ordinary things and ask kids what they would do if it was connected to a computer and/or the internet.

It is a creative that brings value to both parties
* __Kids__ learn to code while thinking witout bounderies
* __Brands__ get a glimpse of what is possible if they think outside their product development processes
